
## About The Project
OOP-project-2022 lets users search a shopping list from all five top online supermarkets in Estonia -- Prisma, Rimi, Selver, Maxima, and Coop. The project will provide an overview of prices for each item in the list so that the user can make a more informed choice on where to shop, thus saving time and money.

It also provides multiple other useful features, such as saving your shopping list for future use and searching for discounts (either regular or by loyalty card), thus keeping you updated with the latest deals.

**Development of this project is split into three stages:**
## Stage 1
* The program will find products specified by a given keyword from all five leading Estonian supermarket chains (Coop, Rimi, Selver, Maxima & Prisma) by dynamically scraping HTML and JavaScript content from their online delivery websites to make a list of found products.
* The program can independently differentiate if a product is on sale and if the product is cheaper with said supermarkets discount card. It also saves the discount price and prediscount price for all products.

## Stage 2 (complete)
* Most of the GUI is implemented using JavaFX
* Added registration and log-in support for multiple users.
* Made saving a shopping list for future usage possible.
* Made searching by a given list possible (each user has a file in which their shopping list is saved)
* Added multithread support for faster data collection.
* Organized the project with the use of enums.
* Fixed some runtime bugs and exceptions.
* Added a way to calculate the shortest bird’s-eye-view path between store locations given users’ starting coordinates

### Stage 3 (in progress)
* Better organizing the project hierarchy with the use of abstract classes and interfaces.
* Improving multithreading
* Changing search by xpath to a faster method.
* Fixing bugs and cleaning up code
* Finishing and cleaning up the GUI (e.g. profile viewing)
* Send shopping summary to user’s email.
* Implementing and adding more functionality from the project plan.
