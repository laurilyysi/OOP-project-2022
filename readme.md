About The Project

OOP-project-2022 lets the user search a shopping list from all five top online supermarkets in Estonia. These supermarkets are Prisma, Rimi, Selver, Maxima, Coop.
OP2 tells the user which shop to buy from to pay the cheapest sum for the user's shopping list and informs the user of the cost for said shopping list and the items it contains. It also provides some other useful functions such as being able to save your shopping list for future usage and also searching by the shops discount card prices so you wouldn't miss out on any deals.

Done So Far

Stage 1

The program will find products specified by a given keyword from all five leading Estonian supermarket chains (Coop, Rimi, Selver, Maxima & Prisma) by dynamically scraping HTML and JavaScript content from their online delivery websites and make a list of found products.

The program can independently differentiate if a product is on sale and if the product is cheaper with said supermarkets discount card. It also saves the discount price and prediscount price for all products.


Planned
