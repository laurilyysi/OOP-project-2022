
## About The Project

OOP-project-2022 lets users search a shopping list from all five top online supermarkets in Estonia -- Prisma, Rimi, Selver, Maxima, and Coop. The project will provide an overview of prices for each item in the list so that the user can make a more informed choice on where to shop, thus saving time and money. 
It also provides multiple other useful features, such as saving your shopping list for future use and searching for discounts (either regular or by loyalty card), thus keeping you updated with the latest deals.

**Development of this project is split into three stages:**

## Stage 1 (complete)

* The program will find products specified by a given keyword from all five leading Estonian supermarket chains (Coop, Rimi, Selver, Maxima & Prisma) by dynamically scraping HTML and JavaScript content from their online delivery websites to make a list of found products.

* The program can independently differentiate if a product is on sale and if the product is cheaper with said supermarkets discount card. It also saves the discount price and prediscount price for all products.

## Stages 2 & 3 (in progress)

* Add multithread support for faster data collection.

* Better organizing the project hierarchy with the use of abstract classes and interfaces.

* Changing sale field to enum.

### Implementing other features from project plan, such as:
* Searching by a given list
* Saving shopping list for future usage
* Registration and log-in support for multiple users
* Possibly make an proper user interface
* Fixing and handling runtime bugs and exceptions
* ...and more
